  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.ldu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Ludong University</a> (China) and <a href="https://www.ulsan.ac.kr/" target="_blank">University of Ulsan</a> (South Korea). I am currently a Research Assistant at <a href="https://islab.ulsan.ac.kr/" target="_blank">ISLab</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://islab.ulsan.ac.kr/about.php" target="_blank">Kang-Hyun Jo (조강현)</a>.
  </p> <p>
    My research lies in the interdisciplinary areas of <strong>Robotics</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, and <strong>UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)</strong>. My current work focuses on the integration of image processing and robotics applications.
  </p> <p>
    If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me at any time. I am eager to communicate with you! 🤗
